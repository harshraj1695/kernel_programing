Yes, you can typically **manually change** the Ethernet link speed and duplex settings on a Linux device like the BeagleBone Black.

However, since the **BeagleBone Black**'s Ethernet port is hardware limited to a maximum of **100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet)**, you can only set it to:

  * **10 Mbps** (Half or Full Duplex)
  * **100 Mbps** (Half or Full Duplex)

You cannot set it to 1000 Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) because the physical chip (PHY) on the board doesn't support that speed.

-----

## 🛠️ How to Change the Speed (Using `ethtool`)

The primary command-line utility used on Linux systems (like the Debian OS on the BeagleBone Black) to control network device settings is **`ethtool`**.

### 1\. Check Current Settings

First, check the current status of your Ethernet interface, which is usually named `eth0`:

```bash
ethtool eth0
```

  * Look for the `Speed` and `Duplex` fields to see what the hardware automatically negotiated (`Auto-negotiation`).

### 2\. Manually Set the Speed

You can use `ethtool` to force the speed and duplex. Forcing a speed disables auto-negotiation, so you must specify both speed and duplex.

**Example: Forcing 10 Mbps Full Duplex**

```bash
sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 10 duplex full autoneg off
```

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-s eth0` | | Specifies the interface to change (`s` is for set). |
| `speed 10` | | Sets the speed to 10 Mbps. |
| `duplex full` | | Sets the Duplex to Full (can send and receive at the same time). |
| `autoneg off` | | Turns off automatic negotiation with the connected device. |

**Example: Forcing 100 Mbps Half Duplex**

```bash
sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex half autoneg off
```

-----

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1.  **Non-Permanent:** Changes made with `ethtool` are usually **temporary** and will be lost when you reboot the BeagleBone Black.
2.  **Making it Permanent:** To make the change permanent, you would need to add the `ethtool` command to a **startup script** (like an `/etc/rc.local` file or a system service file) that runs every time the system boots up.
3.  **Duplex Matching:** If you manually set the speed and duplex, you **must** ensure the device on the *other end* of the cable (e.g., your router or PC) is set to the **exact same speed and duplex**. If they don't match, you will experience poor performance or the link may fail entirely (this is called a **duplex mismatch**).
